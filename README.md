My Super Cool Smile Website!

This is my website about smiles! I made it to show people how to smile and be happy.

What it does:

Shows cool pictures of smiles! 😀
Lets you learn from famous smilers 😎
Has videos to teach you how to smile (I gotta add those later!)
Explains why smiling is good for you 😁
How to use it:

Open the website on your computer. 💻
Click on the stuff you want to see. 🖱️
Learn how to smile like a pro! 🏆
What I used to make it:

HTML (like the building blocks of the website)
CSS (like the paint and stuff that makes it look nice)
Font Awesome (for the little icons)
Help me make it better!

I don't really know how to code yet. 😕
If you see anything weird, let me know! 🐞
Maybe you can help me add some videos? 📹
Things to do next:

Add more pictures of smiles! 😄
Write some funny text about smiling. 😂
Make it look even more awesome with cooler colors! 🌈
